## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Well, I have done all this with CSS Grid and Flex for some things, It may be not the best way to do it, I was looking for doing this wihtout any mediaQuerys but I didn't find a proper way to do that, so I just put a Query on 600px and a width around 350px of the box, so It may look a little bit different compare to the template on the challenge. 

Anyways, if you have any suggestions you can talk to me and I would be very happy to improve with CSS Grid (which is not my very best) and see what you can do for me. If you need a guide to do this, just watch the code and live on Github Pages.

Thanks you and Happy code!
